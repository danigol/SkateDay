# SkateDay
Is today a skate day? Let's take a look at the weather during your commute times and figure it out!

Ok, you can use it for cycling too, just don't tell anyone I sent you.

Let this app know when you commute, how long your commute is, where you are (or where you're going), whether or not you skate in the rain (what, you don't have a rain setup?), and what the minimum temperature is for skating. I don't like to freeze my face off either. 

With that, we'll tell you if it's a skate day or not!

What constitutes a skate day?

Warm (enough) weather, sunny weather (if you need sun), and whether or not it rained yesterday. If it rained overnight, we'll warn you to use your rain setup in the AM!

Stop spending 10 minutes every morning figuring out how to get to your office and just ask SkateDay, hey, is it a skate day?
